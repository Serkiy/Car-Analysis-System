# Smart Car Health Monitor

## Description

Smart Car Health Monitor is an intelligent system built with a **Raspberry Pi** that monitors the car's status in real time through **OBD-II** and provides notifications to the driver if critical values or anomalies are detected. It helps improve safety and prevent malfunctions, with live data visualization via a **web dashboard** or mobile app.

## Features

- Read data from the ECU via OBD-II (engine temperature, RPM, battery voltage, vehicle speed, etc.)
- Continuous monitoring of critical parameters
- Real-time alerts and notifications
- Storage of historical data for trend analysis
- Detection of abnormal patterns in vehicle behavior

---

## Components

**Hardware:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 (or Pi 3B+/Pi Zero 2 W)
- OBD-II USB/Bluetooth module
- Breadboard and jumper cables
- USB-C 5V/3A power supply

**Software:**
- Python 3
- Flask or Django for web dashboard
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for data storage
- Python libraries: `pyOBD`, `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` (optional for charts)

## System Architecture

```
Car (ECU) --> OBD-II Module --> Raspberry Pi --> Data Processing + Anomaly Detection --> Web Dashboard / Notifications
```

- **Raspberry Pi:** central processor, collects and analyzes data.
- **OBD-II Module:** reads data from the car.
- **Dashboard:** displays data, trends, and alerts to the driver.
